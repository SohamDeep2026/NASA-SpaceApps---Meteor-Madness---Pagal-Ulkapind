# NASA-SpaceApps---Meteor-Madness---Pagal-Ulkapind

## Project Summary - Meteor Madness
We have developed an interactive asteroid impact simulation and visualization platform that combines NASA Near-Earth Object (NEO) data with USGS environmental datasets to model and communicate asteroid impact consequences. It allows the users to enter, or change, asteroid parameters such as size, velocity, impact angle, and density, and physically computes the results of the impact, including crater size, impact energy, seismic magnitude, thermal effects, and tsunami generation, which are then displayed on an interactive world map with hazard zones and estimates of populations affected from live NASA SEDAC population density data.

The project thus tackles the challenge of translating complex astronomical threats into understandable and actionable levels, combining scientific rigor with user-friendly controls and live visualization. Furthermore, it supports the decision-making process with policymakers and scientific communities testing "what-if" scenarios and alternate mitigation avenues and serves as an educational tool for students and the general public.

This effort remains vital given that planetary defense is a global concern. By turning raw NASA and USGS data into a user-friendly interactive tool, our project increases awareness, preparedness, and scientific engagement around asteroid risks and potentialÂ responses.
